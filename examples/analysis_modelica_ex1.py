This example file shows how to load the models using a method based approach for use in Modelica.
The run_model takes only a list of numbers (int and floats). The categorical variables are
converted as needed in order to correctly populate the list of covariates in the dataframe.

For use in Modelica ake sure that the python path is set, such as by running
export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`

Call the following bash command shown below to run this example. This example runs as an
entrypoint; however, when connected to modelica the def run_model will be called directory. Also,
note that the run_model method loads the models every time it is called. This is non-ideal when
using this code in a timestep by timestep simulation. Work needs to be done to determine how to
load the reduced order models only once and call the reduced order model yhat methods each timestep.
